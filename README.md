# Survival-Analysis
 In this project, we build an appropriate survival model to determine which factors (educational
level, electricity, sex, and marriage) affect the age of death of people in Bihar, a state in India, in
2007.the whole data set contained 770,000 observations from 9 different states over about 6 years. The data set had 121 variables so we
narrowed our data set down to 9 variables (ID, Sex, Age of Death, marital status, highest
Education, Electricity, and our added variables that we filtered: Censored Age of Death, Marital
Status Category and Highest Education Category).
